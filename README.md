## Description

This project is a task management application that utilizes **Redux** for state management and **MongoDB** for data storage. The application provides a user-friendly interface to manage tasks across different boards.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React
- **State Management**: Redux
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **TypeScript** for type safety

## Features

- Create, update, and delete boards and tasks.
- Ability to move tasks between different boards.
- Basic form validation for task creation.
- Integration with Redux for managing application state.

## Notable Implementations

- All API requests are handled using **Axios**.
- Redux Thunks are utilized for asynchronous operations.
- Error handling for API requests is implemented to manage failures gracefully.

## Limitations

- Drag and drop functionality was not implemented due to time constraints.
- However, the application allows tasks to be moved between boards.
